## Vite + WordPress Integration

This theme uses `manifest.json` generated by Vite to enqueue compiled assets in `functions.php`.

Make sure your manifest path is correct:

```php
$manifest_path = get_stylesheet_directory() . '/dist/manifest.json';
```

This is parsed to load your `main.ts`-compiled JS and CSS files into the theme.
